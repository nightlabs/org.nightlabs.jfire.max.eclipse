	 * for an ArticleEdit with selected Articles (unselected Articles are generally
	 * ignored).
	 * </p>

	 * it is working in the following way: If at least
	 * one <code>ArticleEdit</code> in the active <code>SegmentEdit</code> has a delegate,
	 * then this action is visible - otherwise not.
	 * </p>

	 * Note, that this method is <b>not</b> called, if the current <code>SegmentEdit</code>
	 * does not contain any <code>ArticleEdit</code> (i.e. is empty) or if there is no current
